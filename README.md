My apologies for the confusion. Let's create a README.md specifically for a moderation Discord bot with the mentioned features:

# Moderation Discord Bot

## Overview

This is a custom moderation bot designed for Discord servers. The bot comes equipped with various moderation features to help server administrators effectively manage and maintain their communities.

## Features

### 1. Kick Command

The bot allows server administrators to kick users from the server. The kick command ensures that problematic users are temporarily removed from the server to maintain a healthy environment.

Usage:
```
/kick @user [reason]
```

### 2. Ban Command

Server administrators can use the ban command to permanently ban disruptive or harmful users from the server. This feature helps to ensure long-term moderation and safety.

Usage:
```
/ban @user [reason]
```

### 3. Mute Command

The mute command enables server administrators to temporarily mute users who are causing disruptions. This helps in managing chat spam or controlling unruly behavior.

Usage:
```
/mute @user [time] [reason]
```

### 4. Unmute Command

The bot provides an un-mute command to reverse the effects of the mute command and allow users to chat again after their mute duration has ended.

Usage:
```
/unmute @user
```

### 5. Purge Command

Server administrators can use the purge command to mass-delete messages in a text channel. This feature is helpful for cleaning up spam or removing unwanted content.

Usage:
```
/purge [amount]
```

### 6. Slowmode Command

The slowmode command helps to control the rate of messages in a text channel. Server administrators can set a cooldown period between messages to prevent spam.

Usage:
```
/slowmode [duration]
```

### 7. Lock Command

The lock command allows server administrators to lock a specific text channel, preventing users from sending new messages. This feature is useful for temporary control during important announcements or events.

Usage:
```
/lock [duration] [reason]
```

### 8. Unlock Command

The unlock command reverses the effects of the lock command, allowing users to send messages in a previously locked text channel.

Usage:
```
/unlock
```

### 9. Infraction Logging

The bot automatically logs all moderation actions, including kicks, bans, mutes, and purges. The logs provide crucial information for reviewing and managing server moderation.

### 10. Permissions Management

The bot supports role-based permissions to ensure that only authorized users can execute moderation commands. It helps maintain control over who can manage the server's moderation features.

## Installation
